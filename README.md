# Overall

For data simulation I was using faker to create a data with country, city, latitude and longitude.
And random avatars from `pravatar` API.

I have two charts:
* Number of students in country
![img.png](img.png)
* Top 10 countries with most students
![img_1.png](img_1.png)

And two maps:
* Number of students per country (heatmap)
![img_2.png](img_2.png)
* Map with pinpoint of every student
